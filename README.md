NTUST Compiler Design Project
=============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zetavg/NTUST-1052-Compiler-Design.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zetavg/NTUST-1052-Compiler-Design)

This project is a compiler implementation of GoÂ¯:
a simple Go-like programming language.


System Requirements
-------------------

- LLVM 3.5+


Usage
-----

Example usage:

```bash
$ bin/compiler tests/samples/example.go -o example
$ ./example
```

To get the LLVM IR, use the `--llvm` option:

```bash
$ bin/compiler tests/samples/example.go --llvm
```

### Standalone Parser

Example usage of the parser:

```bash
$ bin/parser < tests/fixtures/example.go
```

To get an Graphviz diagram of the AST, use the `--graphviz` option:

```bash
$ bin/parser --graphviz < tests/fixtures/example.go
```

### Standalone Scanner

Example usage of the scanner:

```bash
$ bin/scanner < tests/fixtures/example.go
```


Building
--------

`make`, `gcc`, `lex`, `flex` and LLVM are required to build this project:

```bash
$ make
```

the compiled executable will be placed under `bin/` in the project directory.

To clean the project directory, run:

```bash
$ make clean
```


Testing
-------

To run C unit tests, `check` and `checkmk` are needed.
For execution result tests, you'll need `bats`.

```bash
$ make test
```
