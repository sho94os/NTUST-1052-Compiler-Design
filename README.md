This project is a lex scanner implementation of GoÂ¯:
a simple Go programming language.

Usage

Example usage of the scanner:

```bash
$ bin/scanner < tests/fixtures/example.go
```

`make`, `gcc` and `lex` are required to build this project:

```bash
$ make
```

the compiled executable will be placed under `bin/` in the project directory.

To clean the project directory, run:

```bash
$ make clean
```


Testing

To run C unit tests, `check` and `checkmk` are needed.
For execution result tests, you'll need `bats`.
